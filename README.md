# GHAS Lab Builder

A CLI tool for automating the creation and management of GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) lab environments. This tool helps instructors and facilitators quickly provision multiple organizations with pre-configured repositories for hands-on training sessions.

## Features

- **Automated Lab Environment Provisioning**: Create complete lab environments with organizations and repositories for multiple users
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently provision resources using concurrent workers (up to 9 parallel operations)
- **GitHub App Integration**: Install GitHub Apps automatically on newly created organizations
- **Template Repository Support**: Clone from template repositories with optional branch inclusion
- **User Validation**: Validate GitHub usernames before provisioning
- **Facilitator Support**: Separate handling for lab facilitators with their own organizations
- **Granular Control**: Manage individual organizations and repositories independently
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports of lab creation and deletion operations
- **Flexible Authentication**: Support for both Personal Access Tokens (PAT) and GitHub App authentication
- **Enterprise Support**: Works with GitHub Enterprise Cloud and Server

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.25.2 or higher
- GitHub Enterprise account
- One of the following authentication methods:
  - Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions
  - GitHub App credentials (App ID and Private Key)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ghas-lab-automation/ghas-lab-builder.git
cd ghas-lab-builder

# Build the binary
go build -o ghas-lab-builder

# Or install directly
go install
```

## Authentication

The tool supports two authentication methods:

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

```bash
--token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**Required Scopes:**

The classic PAT token must have the following scopes:
- `repo`
- `admin:org`
- `admin:enterprise`

**Note:** GitHub rate limits restrict PAT users to 50 repos per minute and 150 repos per hour. 

---

### GitHub App

```bash
--app-id YOUR_APP_ID --private-key /path/to/private-key.pem
```

**Required Permissions:**

The GitHub App must have the following permissions:

- Repository permissions: 
  - Administration (Read and write)
  - Contents (Read and write)
  - Metadata (Read-only)
- Organization permissions: 
  - Administration (Read and write)
  - Members (Read and write)
- Enterprise permissions: 
  - Enterprise organization installations (Read and write)
  - Enterprise organizations (Read and write)

---

**Important:** You must use either `--token` OR both `--app-id` and `--private-key`, but not both simultaneously.

## Usage

### Lab Commands

Lab commands provide end-to-end management of complete lab environments, including organizations and repositories for all users.

#### Create a Lab Environment

Create a complete lab environment with organizations and repositories for all users:

```bash
ghas-lab-builder lab create \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --lab-date 2025-11-07 \
  --users-file users.txt \
  --facilitators admin1,admin2 \
  --template-repos default/repos.json
```

**What this does:**
- Validates all student and facilitator usernames
- Creates organizations for each user (format: `ghas-labs-2025-11-07-username`)
- Installs the GitHub App on each organization
- Creates all template repositories in each organization
- Generates a comprehensive report

#### Delete a Lab Environment

Remove all organizations and resources created for a lab:

```bash
ghas-lab-builder lab delete \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --lab-date 2025-11-07 \
  --users-file users.txt \
  --facilitators admin1,admin2
```

**What this does:**
- Deletes all organizations created for the specified lab date
- Processes deletions in parallel for efficiency
- Generates a deletion report with success/failure details

### Organization Commands

Organization commands allow you to manage individual organizations independently.

#### Create a Single Organization

Create an organization for a specific user:

```bash
ghas-lab-builder orgs create \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --lab-date 2025-11-07 \
  --user student1 \
  --facilitators admin1,admin2
```

**What this does:**
- Validates the user and facilitators
- Creates organization named `ghas-labs-2025-11-07-student1`
- Installs the GitHub App on the organization
- Adds facilitators as organization owners
- Does NOT create any repositories (use `repo create` for that)

#### Delete a Single Organization

Delete a specific organization:

```bash
ghas-lab-builder orgs delete \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --lab-date 2025-11-07 \
  --user student1
```

**What this does:**
- Deletes the organization `ghas-labs-2025-11-07-student1`
- Removes all repositories and resources within the organization

### Repository Commands

Repository commands allow you to manage repositories within an existing organization.

#### Create Repositories in an Organization

Create repositories from templates in a specific organization:

```bash
ghas-lab-builder repo create \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --org ghas-labs-2025-11-07-student1 \
  --repos default/repos.json
```

**What this does:**
- Creates all repositories defined in the JSON file
- Clones from template repositories
- Optionally includes all branches based on configuration

#### Delete Repositories from an Organization

Delete specific repositories from an organization:

```bash
# Delete specific repositories
ghas-lab-builder repo delete \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --org ghas-labs-2025-11-07-student1 \
  --repos default/repos.json

# Delete ALL repositories in the organization
ghas-lab-builder repo delete \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --org ghas-labs-2025-11-07-student1
```

**What this does:**
- If `--repos` is specified: Deletes only the repositories listed in the JSON file
- If `--repos` is omitted: Deletes ALL repositories in the organization

## File Formats

### Users File (`users.txt`)

Plain text file with comma-separated GitHub usernames:

```
student1,student2,student3,student4
```

### Template Repositories File (`repos.json`)

JSON file defining template repositories to clone:

```json
{
  "lab-env-setup": {
    "repos": [
      {
        "template": "org-name/repo-name",
        "include_all_branches": false
      },
      {
        "template": "org-name/another-repo",
        "include_all_branches": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
- `template`: Full repository path in format `owner/repo-name`
- `include_all_branches`: Whether to clone all branches (true) or only the default branch (false)

## Use Cases

### Complete Lab Setup
Use `lab create` when you need to set up a full lab environment for multiple students from scratch.

### Individual Student Setup
Use `orgs create` + `repo create` when you need to provision resources for a single student who joined late or needs a replacement environment.

### Partial Repository Reset
Use `repo delete` + `repo create` when you need to reset specific repositories without affecting the entire organization.

### Organization Management
Use `orgs delete` when you need to remove a specific student's organization without affecting others in the same lab.

## How It Works

### Lab Creation Process

1. **User Validation**: Validates all student and facilitator GitHub usernames
2. **Organization Creation**: Creates organizations named `ghas-labs-{lab-date}-{username}`
3. **GitHub App Installation**: Installs the configured GitHub App on each organization
4. **Repository Provisioning**: Creates repositories from templates in each organization
5. **Report Generation**: Creates detailed markdown and JSON reports in the `reports/` directory

### Lab Deletion Process

1. **Organization Deletion**: Removes all organizations created for the specified lab date
2. **Parallel Processing**: Uses multiple workers for efficient deletion
3. **Report Generation**: Creates deletion reports with success/failure details

### Organization Naming Convention

Organizations are created with the following naming pattern:
```
ghas-labs-{lab-date}-{username}
```

Example: `ghas-labs-2025-11-07-student1`

## Reports

The tool generates detailed reports in the `reports/` directory:

- **Lab Creation Report**: `lab-report-{lab-date}-{timestamp}.md`
- **Lab Deletion Report**: `lab-delete-report-{lab-date}-{timestamp}.md`

Reports include:
- Total user count
- Success/failure counts
- Individual organization details
- Repository creation status
- Error messages for failures
- Invalid usernames

## Logging

Logs are automatically generated and stored with timestamps:
- Format: `ghas-lab-builder-{timestamp}.log`
- Level: Info (includes errors and warnings)
- Output: Both file and console

## Performance

- **Concurrent Workers**: Up to 9 parallel workers for provisioning/deletion
- **Efficient Processing**: Automatically scales workers based on user count
- **User Validation**: Pre-validates all usernames to avoid failures during provisioning

## Error Handling

- Invalid usernames are reported but don't stop the provisioning process
- Failed organization/repository creations are logged and reported
- Detailed error messages in reports and logs
- Graceful handling of API rate limits and timeouts
